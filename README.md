**CONCEPT**: A tool that collects browser-cookie data, stores it in DB/CSV, performs it in Exploratory Data Analytics(EDA) to uncover common behavioural patterns(e.g. browser-tracking/spying, advertissents, domain-stalking,etc), and applies ML pipelines, such as clustering tracker type by behvioural and performace metrics, or predicting invasives ones, by potential and/or actual chracteristics. 


### What is this repository for? ###

This repository aims to build a powerful, Python-based browser cookie-tracking analytics tool, to study the extent of invasive behaviour and potential of exploitation for more sinister means such as surreptiious data-harvesting or web-scraping, by browser cookies.  It is intended to build awareness on the sheer volume of website trackers and spyware we deal with on a daily basis simply by being online. The results are compiled into a report, which is then further refined by ML pipelines categorizing tracker by cookie type, behaviour, and prediction by the extent of invasiveness.
